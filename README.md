# hello-world
My name is Ben and I am brand new to the coding world.
This website was suggested to me in order to hone my skills and learn all I can about software dev.
I learn best while working on a project, so the slew of open-source projects appealed to me.
I'm hoping to bring these new skills to the MakerSpace I am helping put together.
